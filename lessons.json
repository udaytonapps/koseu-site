You may have selected the wrong term when beginning the site creation process (most classes are in terms that are called something like \"Spring 2020\" or \"Fall 2020\"). More likely is that you are not listed as the instructor of record for the class. Don't worry, you can still create the Isidore site for your roster! You just have to request it, then eLearning will review the request and approve the roster once we determine that you are indeed the instructor."

We've seen people post the syllabus in, no joke, all of these tools: Announcements, Messages, Resources, Syllabus, Lessons, Calendar, and Chat Room. So while YOU may think it's obvious where everything is, your students might not, so it's helpful to, at the very least, tell them where to look in the site for your stuff. Secondly, because it's fun."

If your syllabus is longer than average, then we do recommend adding multiple expandable/collapsible sections to the Syllabus tool (such as 'University Policies', 'Course Information', 'Schedule', and 'Grading Policy') so students can quickly jump to the sections they need most."

Find a location on your computer to save the file. Then, on the same screen where you can rename the document while saving, there is a \"Save as type\" menu. Click that and choose \"PDF\".

The instructor builds a series of puzzles and questions, centered on the learning topic, that have to be solved by the students. This is  similar to the Escape and Breakout rooms that are popular group outing activities. Different groups can race against one another to see who solves the breakout first."
