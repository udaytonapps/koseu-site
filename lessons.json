Last time we asked, only 5% of students said they would want the syllabus posted as a Word Doc or PDF as opposed to have it pasted it in Isidore.

If your syllabus is longer than average, then we do recommend adding multiple expandable/collapsible sections to the Syllabus tool (such as 'University Policies', 'Course Information', 'Schedule', and 'Grading Policy') so students can quickly jump to the sections they need most."

If you have your Word Doc open, press the File button, then the Save As option. Find a location on your computer to save the file. Then, on the same screen where you can rename the document while saving, there is a \"Save as type\" menu. Click that and choose \"PDF\". Press save, and you're done!"
